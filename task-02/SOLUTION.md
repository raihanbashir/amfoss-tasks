# Terminal Hunt
The commands that I used to complete this task are :
1. cd - This command allowed me to change between directories(Folders) and access different files
2. ls - This command shows the list of all the files in the directory you are currently using
3. cp - This command allows a file to be copied into another folder of your choice. You can also rename the file using this command
4. cat - Short for concatenate. This command allows a file to be crated by combining the content of other files
5. rm - This command is used for removing files
6.  git init - This command initiates the folder on the terminal. This command must be used before any other git commands can be used
7. git commit - This command is used to save the changes made to the repository using the terminal
8. git push - This command uploads the changes made to the repository to Github.com
9. git pull - This command downloads the changes made to the repository on Github.com
