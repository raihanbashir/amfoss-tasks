# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
I realised that i enjoyed programming when i first learned python in the 7th grade. The idea of creating a something to get the solution
of the problem presented before me was something that apealed to me. I am a hard worker and can stay focused on any task given to me. I
have been known to be lazy but i think that enables me to figure out the most efficient method to solve any given task. Im not one to pass
up any of the oppurtunities presented to me and will do my best to make sure to come out on top
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I plan on learning as many programming languages necessary to become a jack of all trades, so that I can figure what I want to specialise in
be it Artificial Intelligence or Web Developement
### How would you contribute back to the club?
I will not shy away from any task presented to me and promise to give my all adn do my best to come out on top regardless of the situation
### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
I dont have any negative feedback about the selection process, I found that it was fair and that it gave us ample time to learn for and finish
the tasks given
