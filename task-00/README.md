# Install Ubuntu 20.04(Desktop)
In all honesty, I was quite intimidated when i started this task, as i have never properly used any other operating system other than Windows
and the chance that i could wipe my hard-drive in the process did add onto the pressure. But I realised that i didnt have to worry and that
I come across something that i couldnt do by myself I could ask for help or at least look it up online. After that realisation it was smooth
sailing, i didnt come across anything that i couldnt solve with a little research.
